        HTML is the abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is the code, or language that is used for the creation of basic website layouts. It can look a little daunting if you've never done any coding before, but all you need to try it out is an ordinary text editing application and an internet browser. You might even recognize some HTML used to change text in online forums, customized online profiles, or even some wikiHow articles. HTML is a useful tool for anyone who uses the internet, and learning the basics may take you less time than you think.
